In this article, we assert that these discussions of teaching and learning must attend to the human dimensions of data work. Specifically, we draw from several established lines of research to argue that practices involving the creation and manipulation of data are shaped by a combination of personal experiences, cultural tools and practices, and political concerns. We demonstrate through two examples how our proposed humanistic stance highlights ways that efforts to make data personally relevant for youth also necessarily implicate cultural and sociopolitical dimensions that affect the design and learning opportunities in data-rich learning environments. We offer an interdisciplinary framework based on literature from multiple bodies of educational research to inform design, teaching and research for more effective, responsible, and inclusive student learning experiences with and about data.},

	abstract = {Data preparation (also called “wrangling” or “cleaning”) – the evaluation and manipulation of data prior to formal analysis – is often dismissed as a precursor to meaningful engagement with a dataset. Here, we reenvision data preparation in light of calls to prepare students for a datarich world. Traditionally, curricular statistics explorations involve data that are derived from observations that students record themselves or that reflect familiar, relatively closed systems. In contrast, pre-constructed public data­ sets are much larger in scope and involve temporal, geographic, and other dimensions that complicate inference and blur boundaries between “signal” and “noise.” As a result, students have fewer opportunities to consider sources of variability in such datasets. Due to these constraints, we argue that data preparation becomes an important site for students to reason about variability with public data. Through analyses of repeated task-based interviews with five pairs of adolescent participants, we find that specific actions during data preparation, such as filtering data or calculating new measures, presented opportunities to engage leaners with variability as they prepared and analyzed several public socioscientific datasets. More broadly, our study highlights some changes to theory and curriculum in statistics education that are necessitated by a focus on “big data literacy”.},

	abstract = {There is considerable debate and ambiguity around what constitutes “computational thinking” (CT). In contrast to Computer Science which is generally treated as a distinct ﬁeld of study, CT as a construct highlights the integral relationship between computing and other ﬁelds. Many recent eﬀorts seek to map computational thinking by making high-level connections to other school disciplines. We argue that while these eﬀorts may help identify speciﬁc curricular areas in which computing is likely to take place, they do not suﬃciently capture the speciﬁcity and dynamism that is characteristic of meaningful computational integration. Worse, they exclude generative examples of computing integration that exist outside of the traditional STEM context or researcher-led eﬀorts. In this special issue, we oﬀer a counterproposal to one-size-ﬁts-all frameworks of CT by exploring in detail how local, emergent deﬁnitions of CT develop across a diversity of spaces of learning. Reﬂecting on these examples can help researchers and educators alike cultivate an awareness of the ways in which learners and educators leverage computing to think, create, and participate across a variety of spaces.},

There is still a need, however, to more deeply conceptualize what a field of Data Science Education might entail in terms of scope, responsibility, and execution. This special issue explores how one distinguishing feature of Data Science—its focus on data collected from social and environmental contexts within which learners often find themselves deeply embedded—suggests serious implications for learning and education. The learning sciences is uniquely positioned to investigate how such contextual embeddings impact learners’ engagement with data including along conceptual, experiential, communal, racialized, spatial, and political dimensions. This special issue demonstrates the richly layered relationships learners build with data and reveals them to be not merely utilitarian mechanisms for learning about data, but a critical part of navigating data as social text and understanding Data Science as a discipline. Together, the contributions offer a vision of how the learning sciences can contribute to a more expansive, agentive and socially aware Data Science Education.},

This paper complements research that explores how interviewers are likely to aﬀect student framings, by exploring how subtler interactions can lead students to change their framings, and thus their behaviour, in unexpected ways. We present data from interviews with two students, Sarah and Omar, as they reasoned about evaporation and condensation. Sarah demonstrated spontaneous changes in how she participated over the course of the interview, whereas Omar demonstrated subtler changes that existing methods may not capture. These changes aﬀected the nature of scientiﬁc knowledge and reasoning demonstrated by each participant, but could not be fully explained by response to interviewer behaviour. We use the constructs of footing and positioning theory to examine how students participated during the interviews, and how this aﬀected the ways they demonstrated knowledge and reasoning about the interview topic. In both cases, footing and positioning theory allowed us to better understand the dynamic ways students engage in the interview. This paper contributes new methods for analysing complex interview dynamics, and suggests situations for which such methods are necessary.},

We ask: What opportunities emerge for students to reason about the relationship between data, context, and uncertainty when they repurpose public data to explore questions about their local communities? And, How can these opportunities be supported in classroom instruction and activity design? In two exploratory studies, students were asked to pose questions about their communities, use publicly-available data to investigate those questions, and create visual displays and written stories about their findings. Across both enactments, opportunities for reasoning emerged especially when students worked to reconcile (1) their own knowledge and experiences of the context from which data were collected with details of the data provided; and (2) their different emerging stories about the data with one another. We review how these opportunities unfolded within each enactment at the level of group and classroom, with attention to facilitator support.},

	abstract = {In computational modeling activities, learners are expected to discover the inner workings of scientiﬁc and mathematical systems: First elaborating their understandings of a given system through constructing a computer model, then ‘‘debugging’’ that knowledge by testing and reﬁning the model. While such activities have been shown to support science learning, difﬁculties building and using computational models are common and reduce learning beneﬁts. Drawing from Collins and Ferguson (Educ Psychol 28(1):25–42, 1993), we conjecture that a major cause for such difﬁculties is a misalignment between the epistemic games (modeling strategies) learners play, and the epistemic forms (model types) a given modeling environment is designed to support. To investigate, we analyzed data from a study in which ten groups of U. S. ﬁfth graders (n = 28) worked to create stop motion animations and agent-based computational models (ABMs) to discover the particulate nature of matter. Content analyses revealed that (1) groups that made progress—that is, that developed increasingly mechanistic, explanatory models—focused on elements, movement, and interactions when developing their models, a strategy well-aligned with both animation and ABM; (2) groups that did not make progress focused on sequences of phases, a strategy well-aligned with animation but not with ABM; and (3) struggling groups progressed when they received guidance about modeling strategies, but not when they received guidance about model content. We present summary analyses and three vignettes to illustrate these ﬁndings, and share implications for research and curricular design.},

Less is known about what teachers identify as mathematical models, even though it is teachers who ultimately enact modeling activities in the classroom. In this study, we asked nine middle school teachers with a variety of academic backgrounds and teaching experience to collect data related to one familiar physical phenomenon, cooling liquid. We then asked each participant to construct a model of that phenomenon, describe why it was a model, and identify whether a variety of artifacts representing the phenomenon also counted as models during a semi-structured interview. We sought to identify: what do mathematics teachers attend to when describing what constitutes a model? And, how do their attentions shift as they engage in different activities related to models? Using content analysis, we documented what features and purposes teachers attended to when describing a mathematical model. When constructing their own model, they focused on the visual form of the model and what quantitative information it should include. When deciding whether particular representational artifacts constituted models, they focused on how the representations reﬂected the system under study, and what purposes those representations could serve in further understanding that system. These ﬁndings suggest teachers may have multiple understandings of models, which are active at different times and reﬂect different perspectives. This has implications for research, teacher education, and professional development.},

Content analyses of group discussions and lesson plans document attention to content, representation, revision, and evaluation as interwoven aspects of modeling over the course of the workshop. When animating, only content and representation were heavily represented in group discussions. When simulating, all four aspects were represented to different extents across groups. Those differences corresponded with different planned uses for the technology during lessons: to teach modeling, to engage learners with one another’s ideas, or to reveal student ideas. We identify speciﬁc ways in which technology served an important role in eliciting teachers’ knowledge and goals related to scientiﬁc modeling in the classroom.},

We find that experts are more likely to refer to definitions when questioning or explaining some aspect of the focal mathematical idea and more likely to refer to specific examples or instantiations when making sense of an unknown aspect of that idea. However, in general, they employ a variety of types of mathematical resources simultaneously. Often, these combinations are used to deconstruct the mathematical idea in order to isolate, identify, and explore its subcomponents. Some common patterns in the ways experts combined these resources are presented, and we consider implications for education.},

The purpose of this paper is to explore whether and how constructionist computer-supported collaborative environments can explicitly engage students in this practice. The Categorizer is a Javascript-based interactive gallery that allows members of a learning community to contribute computational artifacts they have constructed to a shared collection. Learners can then analyze the collection of artifacts, and sort them into user-deﬁned categories. In a formative case study of the Categorizer for a fractal activity in three middle grade (ages 11–14) classrooms, there was evidence that participating students began to evaluate fractals based on structural and mathematical properties, and afterward could create algorithms that would generate fractals with particular area reduction rates. Further analysis revealed that students’ construction and categorization experiences could be better integrated by explicitly scaffolding discussion and negotiation of the categorization schemes they develop. This led to the development of a new module that enables teachers and students to explore points of agreement and disagreement across student categorization schemes. I conclude with a description of limitations of the study and environment, implications for the broader community, and future work.},

	abstract = {Modeling and using technology are two practices of particular interest to K-12 science educators. These practices are inextricably linked among professionals, who engage in modeling activity with and across a variety of representational technologies. In this paper, we explore the practices of ﬁve sixth-grade girls as they generated models of smell diffusion using drawing, stop-motion animation, and computational simulation during a multi-day workshop. We analyze video, student discourse, and artifacts to address the questions: In what ways did learners’ modeling practices, reasoning about mechanism, and ideas about smell shift as they worked across this variety of representational technologies? And, what supports enabled them to persist and progress in the modeling activity? We found that the girls engaged in two distinct modeling cycles that reﬂected persistence and deepening engagement in the task. In the ﬁrst, messing about, they focused on describing and representing many ideas related to the spread of smell at once. In the second, digging in, they focused on testing and revising speciﬁc mechanisms that underlie smell diffusion. Upon deeper analysis, we found these cycles were linked to the girls’ invention of ‘‘oogtom,’’ a representational object that encapsulated many ideas from the ﬁrst cycle and allowed the girls to restart modeling with the mechanistic focus required to construct simulations. We analyze the role of activity design, facilitation, and technological infrastructure in this pattern of engagement over the course of the workshop and discuss implications for future research, curriculum design, and classroom practice.},

	title = {Learning from “interpretations of innovation” in the co-design of digital tools},
	abstract = {Learning Sciences researchers often design alongside the learners and other stakeholders they seek to support – involving them early and often in the
conceptualization, development, and testing of learning environments (DiSalvo, 2016; Druin, 2002). This is done to preempt technical or pragmatic issues with design, to address problems of practice, and to build capacity for institutional change. However, designers often run into a more foundational issue: stakeholders hold different expectations about what types of learning a given design is meant to support (Könings et al., 2005; Könings e al., 2014; Wilkerson, 2017). These “interpretation(s) of innovation” (Fishman, 2014, p. 117) reveal different underlying goals and epistemologies held by
designers, learners, and other stakeholders. In other words, they reveal which kinds of learning stakeholders expect or value, and whether those kinds of learning appear to be supported by the environment or not.

In this chapter, we argue that designers ought to (a) invite, attend to, and
learn from different interpretations of designed innovations and (b) respond
by expanding the designed environments to support more varied uses. We
contend that this is especially needed when designed tools and environments
are intended to introduce an audience to new or unfamiliar epistemic practices, such as those making use of digital tools.

Then, we describe two methodological approaches we have developed to
engage in this type of collaborative design. The first, longitudinal tool interviews, involves conducting repeated task-based design interviews with learners over extended periods of time. These interviews invite active negotiation of what kinds of learning a digital tool should to support. The second, backward conjecture mapping, engages stakeholders from diverse educational contexts with the same digital tool, in an effort to support a variety of applications. Both approaches provide opportunities for researchers to renegotiate their understanding of tool design, for learners and educators to
experience new epistemological orientations and knowledge-building
strategies, and for both parties to expand their conceptualizations of what is possible when digital tools and practices are introduced into formal learning
environments.},

We then present focal group case studies to further unpack how participation shifted over time and suggest what factors contributed to these shifts.

	abstract = {Climate change is a pressing societal challenge. It is also a pedagogical challenge and a worldwide phenomenon, whose local impacts vary across different locations. Climate change reflects global inequity; communities that contribute most to emissions have greater economic resources to shelter from its consequences, while the lowest emitters are most vulnerable. It is scientifically complex, and simultaneously evokes deep emotions. These overlapping issues call for new ways of science teaching that center personal, social, emotional, and historical dimensions of the crisis. In this article, we describe a middle school science curriculum approach that invites students to explore large-scale data sets and author their own data stories about climate change impacts and inequities by blending data and narrative texts. Students learn about climate change in ways that engage their personal and cultural connections to place; engage with complex causal relationships across multiple variables, time, and space; and voice their concerns and hopes for our climate futures. Connections to relevant science, data science, and literacy standards are outlined, along with relevant data sets and assessments.},

In this sense, traditional concerns over supporting the development of ‘digital literacy’ are now being usurped by concerns over citizens’ ‘data literacies’. In contrast to recent data safety and data science approaches, this article argues for a more critical form of ‘personal data literacies’ where digital data are understood as socially situated and context dependent. Drawing on the critical literacies tradition, the article outlines a range of salient socio-technical understandings of personal data generation and processing. Specifically, the article proposes a framework of ‘Personal Data Literacies’ that distinguishes five significant domains: (1) Data Identification, (2) Data Understandings, (3) Data Reflexivity, (4) Data Uses, and (5) Data Tactics. The article concludes by outlining the implications of this framework for future education and research around the area of individuals’ understandings of personal data.},

	title = {Catalyzing a {New} {Field}: {Data} {Science} {Education} in {K}-12},
	abstract = {Executive Summary: Panel Recommendations The National Center for Education Research (NCER) convened a Technical Working Group (TWG) panel of experts to provide recommendations on the steps IES can take to improve the state of data science education research. A full list of panelist recommendations, panelist references and resources, and the meeting’s agenda is provided in the appendix. Panelists defined data science through different lenses. Data science is often described as an inter-disciplinary field combining statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge, along with data ethics, or civic responsibility with data. A working definition was proposed to articulate the practice of data science as an iterative process of collecting data from the realworld and posing questions, exploring and modelling data, and then producing knowledge or automation. A brief discussion distinguishing unique data science processes from statistics and computer science can be found on p. 11, and the need for identifying universal learning outcomes for K-12 students on p. 10. Concurrently, there was a clear consensus amongst panelists that perfecting definitions would unnecessarily delay tangible progress. Instead, panel members recommended that the education research community should instead focus on building different models and approaches for data science education, and then study what works through pilots and rigorous evaluations. Panelists emphasized the urgency of investing in data science education research, given that students already interact with data on a daily basis, have pre-conceived notions of what data is and is not, and are increasingly avid consumers of digital information. Currently, students in K12 education have limited formal learning opportunities focused on data science. To achieve effective, equitable data science education, panelists made recommendations for additional research focused on the following goals: 1. Articulate the Developmental Pathway: Panelists suggested more research is needed to better articulate the grades K-12 learning pathways for students. These questions include: 1) how to characterize the unique intersection of skills covered in data science versus statistics or computer science courses; 2) whether to design a separate pathway or integrate data science into existing school subjects such as math, science, or social studies; and 3) which topics should be taught when (K-5, 6-8, and 9-12 grade-levels) to be developmentally appropriate and accessible. 2. Assess and Improve Data Science Software: Expanding on Recommendation \#1, panelists called for additional research to assess which data analysis software tools should be incorporated into instruction and when (tinker-based tools, spreadsheets, professional software, or other tools) to be developmentally appropriate and accessible. Panelists highlighted significant challenges and barriers created by existing data science tools and terminology, particularly for English learners and students with disabilities. Additional research and investments are needed to expand and ensure accessibility before data science programs and tools can be widely implemented

7 3. Build Tools for Measurement and Assessment: Panelists highlighted how existing assessment tools do not cover the skillsets nor acumen unique to data science and data literacy. Additional research is needed to develop classroom assessment tools to support teachers and to track students’ success and progress, and to ensure students may earn transferable credit for their work. Panelists also highlighted the need to develop holistic measurement frameworks, inclusive of students’ data science interests, attitudes, identity, and career aspirations; social-emotional outcomes; and longitudinal labor market and career outcomes. 4. Integrate Equity into Schooling and Systems: Panelists emphasized the importance of equity in opportunities and access to high quality data science education for all learners. Data science education research should be conducted through an equity lens that critically examines what is researched and for whom the research benefits. Panelists recommended that research on data science education should include: 1) identifying best practices for ensuring equitable access to and enrollment in data science education opportunities, 2) researching and developing data science software and learning experiences that ensure all students, inclusive of students with disabilities, can access content, 3) ensuring diverse representation of stakeholders, from the researchers to the teachers to the students participating in the study, and 4) examining learning models for students to critically address bias, fairness, and justice that may be inherent in the data and in the interpretation and use of the data. 5. Improve Implementation: Panelists highlighted several systemic barriers to successfully implementing and scaling data science education policies and practices, including insufficient resources, lack of teacher training, and misalignment in required coursework and credentials between K-12, postsecondary education, and industry. The panel called for research to evaluate different implementation approaches to reduce these barriers and increase the scalability of data science education policies and practices. Panelists also recommended research on the development and testing of scalable models for implementing data science policies and practices.},

	abstract = {Our increasingly data-driven world is amplifying the need for everyone to develop foundational data literacy skills. In response, a growing number of K-12 data science curricula are being designed to introduce all students to data. These curricula define what data science is at the high school level and directly shape how students are introduced to and understand the discipline. Ensuring these curricula are effective, engaging, and, most critically, equitable is of paramount importance. This paper presents a qualitative analysis of four curricula, focusing on the data used to introduce learners to the field of data science. The analysis uses a series of analytical lenses to evaluate the 296 distinct datasets used across the curricula and identifies trends and best practices in dataset selection. The analysis includes using data collected from high school students about their interests and experiences with data to understand if and how contemporary data science curricula are tapping into students' lived experiences to situate data science learning experiences. The findings show that the curricula use relatively recent and small datasets covering a range of topics and that there is limited learner involvement in dataset selection. Further, the analysis reveals gaps between the datasets used and students' self-reported interests. This work highlights the importance of dataset selection, especially as it relates to supporting learners from historically excluded populations in technology fields. Finally, this paper provides practical implications to assess existing curricula and advances our understanding of how to situate the field of data science in the interests, ideas, and values of today’s students.},

The goal is not to advocate one particular approach to the design of learning environments but rather to raise awareness of the need to consider this lens in statistics education. We first present the rationale for the importance of a focus on learning environments for statistics education. We provide several examples of learning environments that operationalize and integrate various design perspectives and are informed by two theoretical frameworks: social constructivist theory of learning and realistic mathematics education theory. We discuss these examples in a critical way by comparing and evaluating their designs, looking for common threads among them, and develop from them six design considerations for statistics learning environments. Finally, we discuss implications and emerging directions and goals for further implementation and research.},

	abstract = {Data-driven decision making is fast becoming a necessary skill in jobs across the board. The industry today uses analytics and machine learning to get useful insights from a wealth of digital information in order to make decisions. With data science becoming an important skill needed in varying degrees of complexity by the workforce of the near future, we felt the need to expose school-goers to its power through a hands-on exercise. We organized a half-day long data science tutorial for kids in grades 5 through 9 (10-15 years old). Our aim was to expose them to the full cycle of a typical supervised learning approach - data collection, data entry, data visualization, feature engineering, model building, model testing and data permissions. We discuss herein the design choices made while developing the dataset, the method and the pedagogy for the tutorial. These choices aimed to maximize student engagement while ensuring minimal pre-requisite knowledge. This was a challenging task given that we limited the pre-requisites for the kids to the knowledge of counting, addition, percentages, comparisons and a basic exposure to operating computers. By designing an exercise with the stated principles, we were able to provide to kids an exciting, hands-on introduction to data science, as confirmed by their experiences. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the tutorial was the first of its kind. Considering the positive reception of such a tutorial, we hope that educators across the world are encouraged to introduce data science in their respective curricula for high-schoolers and are able to use the principles laid out in this work to build full-fledged courses.},

	abstract = {Participatory sensing is a data collection method in which communities of people collect and share data to investigate large-scale processes. These data have many features often associated with the big data paradigm: they are rich and multivariate, include non-numeric data, and are collected as determined by an algorithm rather than by traditional experimental designs. While not often found in classrooms, arguably they should be since data with these features are commonly encountered in daily life. Because of this, it is of interest to examine how teachers reason with and about such data. We propose methods for describing progress through a statistical investigation. These methods are demonstrated on two groups of secondary mathematics teachers engaged in a model-eliciting activity centered around participatory sensing data. We employ graphical depictions of discrete Markov chains to describe the strategic decisions the teachers follow while analyzing data, and find that this descriptive technique reveals some suggestive patterns, particularly emphasizing the importance of frequent questioning and crafting productive statistical questions.

We used a narrative case study methodology to describe the instructional practices of one music teacher who co-designed a data science curricular unit during a summer professional development program and implemented it in her 5th-grade music classroom. Data collected for this study include in-person and video observations, reflective journals, artifacts, and interviews. Findings suggest that this teacher integrated data science literacies into her classroom by supporting multiple avenues for data storytelling and relying on learners’ everyday discourse and experiences.

Sampling is hence a key factor in making reliable statistical inferences. We first introduce the theme and the key questions this special issue addresses. Then, we provide a brief literature review on reasoning about samples and sampling. This review sets the grounds for the introduction of the five articles and the concluding reflective discussion.

Statistical literacy is portrayed as the ability to interpret, critically evaluate, and communicate about statistical information and messages. It is argued that statistically literate behavior is predicated on the joint activation of five interrelated knowledge bases (literacy, statistical, mathematical, context, and critical), together with a cluster of supporting dispositions and enabling beliefs.

Parallel to the emergence of data science, a new field is developing as well—data science education.Based on our expertise in data science education, gained in our extensive research, the main research topics of the emerging field of data science education have not yet been mapped, and its scope, as reflected by the papers published so far on data science education, has not yet been defined. Several systematic reviews on topics in data science education have been written in recent years, but they tend to focus on specific topics or specific populations, such as K-12 learners.To partially close this gap, we conducted a systematic machine learning–based literature review. We collected 1,048 papers in the field of data science education using both keyword searches in well-established scientific databases as well as semantic searches in semantic scientific databases. Using SPECTER to generate document-level embedding, we clustered the papers by applying the k-means algorithm. The titles and abstracts of the papers were examined manually to identify main cluster topics. The result is a framework of 26 clusters, organized into five superclusters: (a) curriculum, (b) pedagogy, (c) STEM skills, (d) domain adaptation, and (e) social aspects.The large body of literature on data science education that exists and the framework of its research topics that we revealed indicate the birth of a new scientific discipline—data science education.},

Then, we present the results of a co-citation coupling analysis for articles published in one of three recent data science education special issues with research spanning various levels and contexts. This co-citation analysis showed that while there are some common touchpoints, research on data science learning is taking place in a siloed manner.

The chapter begins by arguing for the importance of broader access to the power of statistical inference—which, until recently, has been accessible only to those with extensive knowledge of mathematics—and then traces the philosophical roots of inference. We outline the challenges that students have encountered in learning statistical inference and strategies to facilitate its learning that have capitalized on technological advances. We describe the emergence of informal statistical inference and how researchers have framed the idea over the past decade. Rather than consider formal and informal statistical inference dichotomously, we highlight a number of dimensions along which approaches to statistical inference may differ, providing a richer perspective on how formal and informal statistical inference are related. Cases from classroom research aimed at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels are used to illustrate how informal statistical inference has shaped new ways to approach the teaching and learning of statistical inference. Finally, we outline gaps in research on statistical inference and present our speculations on its future in light of new research on statistical modeling and big data.},

	abstract = {The need to manage, analyze, and extract knowledge from data is pervasive across industry, government, and academia. Scientists, engineers, and executives routinely encounter enormous volumes of data, and new techniques and tools are emerging to create knowledge out of these data, some of them capable of working with real-time streams of data. The nation's ability to make use of these data depends on the availability of an educated workforce with necessary expertise. With these new capabilities have come novel ethical challenges regarding the effectiveness and appropriateness of broad applications of data analyses. The field of data science has emerged to address the proliferation of data and the need to manage and understand it. Data science is a hybrid of multiple disciplines and skill sets, draws on diverse fields (including computer science, statistics, and mathematics), encompasses topics in ethics and privacy, and depends on specifics of the domains to which it is applied. Fueled by the explosion of data, jobs that involve data science have proliferated and an array of data science programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels have been established. Nevertheless, data science is still in its infancy, which suggests the importance of envisioning what the field might look like in the future and what key steps can be taken now to move data science education in that direction. This study will set forth a vision for the emerging discipline of data science at the undergraduate level. This interim report lays out some of the information and comments that the committee has gathered and heard during the first half of its study, offers perspectives on the current state of data science education, and poses some questions that may shape the way data science education evolves in the future. The study will conclude in early 2018 with a final report that lays out a vision for future data science education.},

	abstract = {More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In “The Future of Data Analysis,” he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or “data analysis.” Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name “data science” for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of “data science” programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a \$100M “Data Science Initiative” that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many academic statisticians perceive the new programs as “cultural appropriation.” This article reviews some ingredients of the current “data science moment,” including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data science is really different from statistics. The now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for “scaling up” to “big data.” This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next 50 years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere “scaling up,” but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are “learning from data,” and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today’s data science initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals.

	abstract = {Data science is a new interdisciplinary field of research that focuses on extracting value from data. As an interdisciplinary science it integrates knowledge and methods from computer science, mathematics and statistics, and the domain knowledge of the data. As data science is still forming as a domain, several points of view exist on how to teach data science. The curriculum of many undergraduate data science programs includes advanced knowledge and skills in mathematics, statistics, computer science, and one or more data domains. Several initiatives for designing high school data science curricula have emerged recently. Since it is unrealistic to teach all the above-mentioned advanced topics at the high school level, the high school data science curriculum focuses on a broad understanding of the data science workflow rather than on mathematical and algorithmic details that characterize undergraduate programs. High school computer science pupils, however, are expected to have a deep understanding of algorithms, as algorithms are the heart of computer science. In this paper, we present our attempt to adapt a data science course to computer science high school pupils that incorporates both a broad view on data science and data workflow, as well as deep understanding of data processing algorithms and specifically, machine learning. This course is taught for 10th grade computer science pupils in an Israeli public school, and was also taught in a summer workshop for computer science teachers.},

	isbn = {978-1-4899-2271-7},
	abstract = {Early in this century, most empirically oriented psychologists believed that all motivation was based in the physiology of a set of non-nervous system tissue needs. The theories of that era reflected this belief and used it in an attempt to explain an increasing number of phenomena. It was not until the 1950s that it became irrefutably clear that much of human motivation is based not in these drives, but rather in a set of innate psychological needs. Their physiological basis is less understood; and as concepts, these needs lend themselves more easily to psycho logical than to physiological theorizing. The convergence of evidence from a variety of scholarly efforts suggests that there are three such needs: self-determination, competence, and interpersonal relatedness. This book is primarily about self-determination and competence (with particular emphasis on the former), and about the processes and structures that relate to these needs. The need for interpersonal relat edness, while no less important, remains to be explored, and the findings from those explorations will need to be integrated with the present theory to develop a broad, organismic theory of human motivation. Thus far, we have articulated self-determination theory, which is offered as a working theory-a theory in the making. To stimulate the research that will allow it to evolve further, we have stated self-determination theory in the form of minitheories that relate to more circumscribed domains, and we have developed paradigms for testing predictions from the various minitheories.},

	abstract = {The use of bibliometrics is gradually extending to all disciplines. It is particularly suitable for science mapping at a time when the emphasis on empirical contributions is producing voluminous, fragmented, and controversial research streams. Science mapping is complex and unwieldly because it is multi-step and frequently requires numerous and diverse software tools, which are not all necessarily freeware. Although automated workflows that integrate these software tools into an organized data flow are emerging, in this paper we propose a unique open-source tool, designed by the authors, called bibliometrix, for performing comprehensive science mapping analysis. bibliometrix supports a recommended workflow to perform bibliometric analyses. As it is programmed in R, the proposed tool is flexible and can be rapidly upgraded and integrated with other statistical R-packages. It is therefore useful in a constantly changing science such as bibliometrics.},

	abstract = {In this volume, Lave and Wenger undertake a radical and important rethinking and reformulation of our conception of learning. By placing emphasis on the whole person, and by viewing agent, activity, and world as mutually constitutive, they give us the opportunity to escape from the tyranny of the assumption that learning is the reception of factual knowledge or information. The authors argue that most accounts of learning have ignored its quintessentially social character. To make the crucial step away from a solely epistemological account of the person, they propose that learning is a process of participation in communities of practice, participation that is at first legitimately peripheral but that increases gradually in engagement and complexity.  Learning viewed as situated activity has as its central defining characteristic a process that we call legitimate peripheral participation. By this we mean to draw attention to the point that learners inevitably participate in communities of practitioners and that the mastery of knowledge and skill requires newcomers to move toward full participation in the sociocultural practice of a community. . . . A person's intentions to learn are engaged and the meaning of learning is configured through the process of becoming a full participant in a sociocultural practice.

These two approaches, although ostensibly incompatible, are in fact complementary. It will be shown that the processes of learning and of problem-solving consist in an intricate interplay between operational and structural conceptions of the same notions.},

To realize this potential, our curricula and educational culture must change. While there are opportunities for significant change in many dimensions, we focus more narrowly on computing and call for computing concepts to be integrated into the statistics curricula at all levels. Computational literacy and programming are as fundamental to statistical practice and research as mathematics. We advocate that our field needs to define statistical computing more broadly to include advancements in modern computing, beyond traditional numerical algorithms. Information technologies are increasingly important and should be added to the curriculum, as should the ability to reason about computational resources, work with large datasets, and perform computationally intensive tasks. We present an approach to teaching these topics in combination with scientific problems and modern statistical methods that focuses on ideas and skills for statistical inquiry and working with data. We outline the broad set of computational topics we might want students to encounter and offer ideas on how to teach them. We also discuss efforts to share pedagogical resources to help faculty teach this modern material (including supplemental materials).},

This article describes a social design experiment for spatial justice that focused on changes in the personal mobility of six non-driving, African-American teenagers, who participated in an afterschool bicycle building and riding workshop located in a mid-south city. Our study was designed to teach spatial literacy practices essential for counter-mapping—a discursive practice in which youth used tools similar to those of professional planners to “take place” in the future of their neighborhoods. Using conversation and multimodal discourse analyses with video records, GPS track data, and interactive maps authored by youth, we show how participants in our study had new experiences of mobility in the city, developed technically-articulate criticisms of the built environment in their neighborhoods, and imagined new forms of mobility and activity for the future.},

Increasingly, the decisions that affect our lives—where we go to school, whether we get a car loan, how much we pay for health insurance—are being made not by humans, but by mathematical models. In theory, this should lead to greater fairness: Everyone is judged according to the same rules, and bias is eliminated.But as Cathy O’Neil reveals in this urgent and necessary book, the opposite is true. The models being used today are opaque, unregulated, and uncontestable, even when they’re wrong. Most troubling, they reinforce discrimination: If a poor student can’t get a loan because a lending model deems him too risky (by virtue of his zip code), he’s then cut off from the kind of education that could pull him out of poverty, and a vicious spiral ensues. Models are propping up the lucky and punishing the downtrodden, creating a “toxic cocktail for democracy.” Welcome to the dark side of Big Data.Tracing the arc of a person’s life, O’Neil exposes the black box models that shape our future, both as individuals and as a society. These “weapons of math destruction” score teachers and students, sort résumés, grant (or deny) loans, evaluate workers, target voters, set parole, and monitor our health.O’Neil calls on modelers to take more responsibility for their algorithms and on policy makers to regulate their use. But in the end, it’s up to us to become more savvy about the models that govern our lives. This important book empowers us to ask the tough questions, uncover the truth, and demand change.},

Data Science Framework (EDSF) that is intended to create a
foundation for the Data Science profession definition. The
EDSF includes the following core components: Data Science
Competence Framework (CF-DS), Data Science Body of
Knowledge (DS-BoK), Data Science Model Curriculum
(MC-DS), and Data Science Professional profiles (DSP
profiles). The MC-DS is built based on CF-DS and DS-BoK,
where Learning Outcomes are defined based on CF-DS
competences and Learning Units are mapped to Knowledge
Units in DS-BoK. In its own turn, Learning Units are defined
based on the ACM Classification of Computer Science
(CCS2012) and reflect typical courses naming used by
universities in their current programmes. The paper provides
example how the proposed EDSF can be used for designing
effective Data Science curricula and reports the experience
of implementing EDSF by the Champion Universities that

	abstract = {Background Reporting standards, such as PRISMA aim to ensure that the methods and results of systematic reviews are described in sufficient detail to allow full transparency. Flow diagrams in evidence syntheses allow the reader to rapidly understand the core procedures used in a review and examine the attrition of irrelevant records throughout the review process. Recent research suggests that use of flow diagrams in systematic reviews is poor and of low quality and called for standardised templates to facilitate better reporting in flow diagrams. The increasing options for interactivity provided by the Internet gives us an opportunity to support easy-to-use evidence synthesis tools, and here we report on the development of a tool for the production of PRISMA 2020-compliant systematic review flow diagrams. Methods and Findings We developed a free-to-use, Open Source R package and web-based Shiny app to allow users to design PRISMA flow diagrams for their own systematic reviews. Our tool allows users to produce standardised visualisations that transparently document the methods and results of a systematic review process in a variety of formats. In addition, we provide the opportunity to produce interactive, web-based flow diagrams (exported as HTML files), that allow readers to click on boxes of the diagram and navigate to further details on methods, results or data files. We provide an interactive example here; https://prisma-flowdiagram.github.io/. Conclusions We have developed a user-friendly tool for producing PRISMA 2020-compliant flow diagrams for users with coding experience and, importantly, for users without prior experience in coding by making use of Shiny (https://estech.shinyapps.io/prisma\_flowdiagram/). This free-to-use tool will make it easier to produce clear and PRISMA 2020-compliant systematic review flow diagrams. Significantly, users can also produce interactive flow diagrams for the first time, allowing readers of their reviews to smoothly and swiftly explore and navigate to further details of the methods and results of a review. We believe this tool will increase use of PRISMA flow diagrams, improve the compliance and quality of flow diagrams, and facilitate strong science communication of the methods and results of systematic reviews by making use of interactivity. We encourage the systematic review community to make use of the tool, and provide feedback to streamline and improve their usability and efficiency.},

	abstract = {Purpose Data storytelling courses position students as agents in creating stories interpreted from data about a social problem or social justice issue. The purpose of this study is to explore two research questions: What themes characterized students’ iterative development of data story topics? Looking back at six years of iterative feedback, what categories of data literacy pedagogy did instructors engage for these themes?. Design/methodology/approach This project examines six years of data storytelling final projects using thematic analysis and three years of instructor feedback. Ten themes in final projects align with patterns in feedback. Reflections on pedagogical approaches to students’ topic development suggest extending data literacy pedagogy categories – formal, personal and folk (Pangrazio and Sefton-Green, 2020). Findings Data storytelling can develop students’ abilities to move from being consumers to creators of data and interpretations. The specific topic of personal data exposure or risk has presented some challenges for data literacy instruction (Bowler et al., 2017). What “personal” means in terms of data should be defined more broadly. Extending the data literacy pedagogy categories of formal, personal and folk (Pangrazio and Sefton-Green, 2020) could more effectively center social justice in data literacy instruction. Practical implications Implications for practice include positioning students as producers of data interpretation, such as role-playing data analysis or decision-making scenarios. Social implications Data storytelling has the potential to address current challenges in data literacy pedagogy and in teaching critical data literacy. Originality/value Course descriptions provide a template for future data literacy pedagogy involving data storytelling, and findings suggest implications for expanding definitions and applications of personal and folk data literacies.},

The mentors led science activities, made connections to their collegiate coursework in science, and worked to establish mentor relationships with students in order to motivate them to pursue science upon high school completion. As a result, survey data from the beginning compared to the end of the academic year showed increases in favorable perception of science by as much as 25\%.

	abstract = {Research in science education with multilingual learners (MLs) has expanded rapidly. This rapid expansion can be situated within a larger dialogue about what it means to provide minoritized students with an equitable education. Whereas some conceptions of equity focus on ensuring all students have access to the knowledge, practices, and language normatively valued in K-12 schools (equity as access), increasingly prominent conceptions focus on transforming those knowledge, practices, and language in ways that center minoritized students and their communities (equity as transformation). In this article, we argue that conceptions of equity provide a useful lens for understanding emerging research in science education with MLs and for charting a research agenda. We begin by tracing how conceptions of equity have evolved in parallel across STEM and multilingual education. Then, we provide an overview of recent developments from demographic, theoretical, and policy perspectives. In the context of these developments, we provide a conceptual synthesis of emerging research by our team of early-career scholars in three areas: (a) learning, (b) assessment, and (c) teacher education. Within each area, we unpack the research efforts in terms of how they attend to equity as access while pushing toward equity as transformation. Finally, we propose a research agenda for science education with MLs that builds on and extends these efforts. We close by offering recommendations for making this research agenda coherent and impactful: (a) being explicit about our conceptions of equity, (b) paying attention to the interplay of structure and agency, and (c) promoting interdisciplinary collaboration.},

	abstract = {Computational models are increasingly being used in K-12 science classrooms to engage students in developing and testing explanations of phenomena. However, research has only begun to consider whether integrating computational models into science instruction could be particularly beneficial to students from diverse backgrounds, including a fast-growing population of English learners (ELs) in the U.S. context. As this research begins to take shape, we argue for moving beyond the traditional discourse focused on “accommodating” ELs, which de-emphasizes the assets these students bring, and shifting our attention to the distinct affordances that computational models offer for harnessing ELs’ rich meaning-making potential. In this article, we conceptualize the affordances of computational models for ELs in science instruction. Specifically, we highlight evolving theories in the field of language education that undergird the shift from accommodations to affordances with ELs in the science classroom. We then propose affordances of computational models for ELs in relation to three framework components: modalities, registers, and interactions. Finally, we report on an initial inquiry into these affordances using student interview data from a linguistically diverse elementary science classroom. Ultimately, we argue that an affordances perspective could inform research and the design of learning environments that contribute to broadening participation in science learning and refuting deficit-based views of students traditionally underserved in STEM subjects.},

We argue against the common approach of assuming that regularities are static, and that general traits of individuals are attributable categorically to ethnic group membership. We suggest that a cultural-historical approach can be used to help move beyond this assumption by focusing researchers’ and practitioners’ attention on variations in individuals’ and groups’ histories of engagement in cultural practices because the variations reside not as traits of individuals or collections of individuals, but as proclivities of people with certain histories of engagement with specific cultural activities. Thus, individuals’ and groups’ experience in activities—not their traits—becomes the focus. Also, we note that cultural-historical work needs to devote more attention to researching regularities in the variations among cultural communities in order to bring these ideas to fruition.},

	abstract = {Addressing student conceptions with instruction has been a major issue in physics education for decades. However, too often the focus is on treating student ideas as “misconceptions” rather than as potentially productive ideas with varying degrees of sophistication. This paper introduces learning progressions as models that describe ideas students are likely to hold at varying levels of sophistication. This guidance can help us to focus on students’ existing understanding, rather than on what students do not yet know. With such nuanced and structured models of student learning, we can ensure that our assessments do not just check for whether students have the “right” answer, but obtain a more accurate “picture” of what students truly understand about the content to inform instruction that is responsive to students’ learning needs.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we elaborate the seeds of algebraic thinking perspective, drawing upon Knowledge in Pieces as a heuristic epistemological framework. We argue that students’ pre-instructional experiences in early childhood lay the foundation for algebraic thinking and are a largely untapped resource in developing students’ algebraic thinking in the classroom. We theorize that seeds of algebraic thinking are cognitive resources abstracted over many interactions with the world in children’s pre-instructional experience. Further, we provide examples to demonstrate how the same seeds of algebraic thinking present in early childhood can be invoked in reasoning across contexts, grade levels, and different levels of formality of algebraic instruction. The examples demonstrate how the seeds perspective differs from other accounts of the relationship between children’s early activity and their engagement in algebraic reasoning processes. We anticipate this new theoretical direction for characterizing the nature and development of algebraic thinking will lay the foundation for a robust agenda that sheds light on the development of algebraic thinking and informs algebra instruction, particularly how teachers notice and respond to children’s developing algebraic thinking.},

	abstract = {In this study I investigated how collaborative interactions influence problem-solving outcomes. Conversations of twelve 6th-grade triads were analyzed utilizing quantitative and qualitative methods. Neither prior achievement of group members nor the generation of correct ideas for solution could account for between-triad differences in problem-solving outcomes. Instead, both characteristics of proposals and partner responsiveness were important correlates of the uptake and documentation of correct ideas by the group. Less successful groups ignored or rejected correct proposals, whereas more successful groups discussed or accepted them. Conversations in less successful groups were relatively incoherent as measured by the extent that proposals for solutions in these groups were connected with preceding discussions. Performance differences observed in triads extended to subsequent problem-solving sessions during which all students solved the same kinds of problems independently. These findings suggest that the quality of interaction had implications for learning. Case study descriptions illustrate the interweaving of social and cognitive factors involved in establishing a joint problem-solving space. A dual-space model of what collaboration requires of participants is described to clarify how the content of the problem and the relational context are interdependent aspects of the collaborative situation. How participants manage these interacting spaces is critical to the outcome of their work and helps account for variability in collaborative outcomes. Directions for future research that may help teachers, students, and designers of educational environments learn to see and foster productive interactional practices are proposed.},

At the beginning of such a course, the participants can be confronted with a first example of Civic Statistics and then, as though taking a step back, the participants’ statistical knowledge can be refreshed in several sessions in order to carry out further Civic Statistics activities. A structure for Civic Statistics activities is presented on the one hand to introduce a design for implementing Civic Statistics content in classes following the principles of the Statistical Reasoning Learning Environment, and on the other for understanding the example lesson plans that can be found at CivicStatMap. We provide detailed examples of Civic Statistics activities organized both in short mini-projectsMini-projects and in a longer projectProject.

It identifies knowledge-bases covering meaning for society and policy and critical evaluation and reflection; selected statistical and mathematical constructs and skills; core literacy and mathematical skills; understanding models and modelling, multivariate ideas and textual and rich visual representations; knowledge of research and data production methods and extensions related to official statistics and risk on the societal level; and it emphasises the importance of appropriate dispositions, critical stance, and habits of mind. We offer examples and curriculum tasks that illustrate each of the 11 facets and their interconnectedness. We also describe the use of a ‘radar plot’ tool to support the analysis of how balanced are prospective class activities or test items in terms of covering the 11 facets and tools. The chapter ends with a brief discussion of the implications of the conceptual model and its 11 facets for planning curricula, instruction, and assessments that can promote teaching and learning about Civic Statistics within mathematics education, statistics and data science education, and related disciplines.},

Such models illustrate the structure of connections and measure the strength of association among elements in a network, and they quantify changes in the composition and strength of connections over time. Importantly, ENA enables comparison of networks both directly and via summary statistics, so the method can be used to explore a wide range of qualitative and quantitative research questions in situations where patterns of association in data are hypothesized to be meaningful. While ENA was originally developed to model cognitive networks—the patterns of association between knowledge, skills, values, habits of mind, and other elements that characterize complex thinking—ENA is a robust method that can be used to model patterns of association in any system characterized by a complex network of dynamic relationships among a relatively small, fixed set of elements.},

	abstract = {During the last ten years advances in open-source digital technology, used especially by data science, led to very accessible ways how to obtain, store, process, analyze or share data in almost every human activity. Data science tools bring not only transparency, accessibility, and reproducibility in open science, but also give benefits in open education as learning tools for improving effectiveness of instruction. Together with our pedagogical introduction and review of Jupyter as an interactive multimedia learning tool, we present our three-years long research in the framework of a complex mixed-methods approach which examines physics teachers' perception of Jupyter technology in three groups: Ph.D. candidates in physics education research (PER) (\$N = 9\$), pre-service physics teachers (\$N = 33\$) and in-service physics teachers (\$N = 40\$). Despite the fact that open-source Jupyter notebooks are natural and easy as email or web, the results suggest that in-service teachers are not prepared for Jupyter technology and open analysis, but positively accept open education data presented via another open-source data science tool, R Shiny interactive web application, as an important form of immediate feedback and learning about the quality of their instruction. Simultaneously our instruction results in the frame of the Flipped Learning also indicate that young beginning PER researchers and pre-service physics teachers can master key digital skills to work with Jupyter technology appreciating its big impact on their learning, data and statistical literacy or professional development. All results support the ongoing worldwide effort to implement Jupyter in traditional education as a promising free open-source interactive learning tool to foster learning process, especially for the upcoming young generation.},

	abstract = {Jupyter notebooks are widely used in industry and in academic research, but have only begun to make inroads into the classroom. The design of the Jupyter notebook is in many ways well suited for teaching subjects in information technology and computer science, but it is a tool that departs significantly from a standard text editor or integrated development environment, and thus carries with it several unique advantages as well as several surprising potential pitfalls. As use of Jupyter notebooks has grown, so has criticism of the notebook, for varied reasons: notebooks can behave in unexpected ways, they can be difficult to reproduce, they open up potential security issues, and they may encourage poor coding practices. A set of best practices to guide instructors and help addressing these concerns when using Jupyter notebooks in the classroom is currently lacking. This paper addresses the strengths and weaknesses of the Jupyter notebook for education, drawing on existing literature as well as the author's experience teaching a range of courses with Jupyter notebooks for over five years, and recommends a set of best practices for teaching with the Jupyter notebook.},

              When learning about scientific phenomena, students are expected to
              mechanistically
              explain how underlying interactions produce the observable phenomenon and
              conceptually
              connect the observed phenomenon to canonical scientific knowledge. This paper investigates how the integration of the complementary processes of designing and refining computational models using real‐world data can support students in developing mechanistic and canonically accurate explanations of diffusion. Specifically, we examine two types of shifts in how students explain diffusion as they create and refine computational models using real‐world data: a shift towards mechanistic reasoning and a shift from noncanonical to canonical explanations. We present descriptive statistics for the whole class as well as three student work examples to illustrate these two shifts as 6th grade students engage in an 8‐day unit on the diffusion of ink in hot and cold water. Our findings show that (1) students develop mechanistic explanations as they build agent‐based models, (2) students' mechanistic reasoning can co‐exist with noncanonical explanations, and (3) students shift their thinking toward canonical explanations after comparing their models against data. These findings could inform the design of modeling tools that support learners in both expressing a diverse range of mechanistic explanations of scientific phenomena and aligning those explanations with canonical science.},

	abstract = {Across many scientific disciplines, methods for recording, storing, and analyzing data are rapidly increasing in complexity. Skillfully using data science tools that manage this complexity requires training in new programming languages and frameworks as well as immersion in new modes of interaction that foster data sharing, collaborative software development, and exchange across disciplines. Learning these skills from traditional university curricula can be challenging because most courses are not designed to evolve on time scales that can keep pace with rapidly shifting data science methods. Here, we present the concept of a hack week as an effective model offering opportunities for networking and community building, education in state-of-the-art data science methods, and immersion in collaborative project work. We find that hack weeks are successful at cultivating collaboration and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. Participants self-report that these events help them in both their day-to-day research as well as their careers. Based on our results, we conclude that hack weeks present an effective, easy-to-implement, fairly low-cost tool to positively impact data analysis literacy in academic disciplines, foster collaboration, and cultivate best practices.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              – This article aims to summarize the employers' requirements of scientific data specialists and the status quo of LIS education organizations' training system for scientific data specialists. It also focuses on the matching analysis between the course content and the responsibilities as well as requirements of scientific data specialists. Moreover, in order to provide some indications for LIS education of scientific data specialists in China, it presents the training objectives and modes.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              – Some job portals for librarians and the comprehensive job portals are investigated as information sources and the keywords such as “scientific data management”, “data service”, “data curation”, “e-Science”, “e-Research”, “data specialist” are selected to retrieval library-released job advertisements for scientific data specialists to understand the library's requirements towards scientific data specialists' core capabilities. Meanwhile the course catalogues of all iSchools' web sites are searched directly in order to find if scientific data courses are provided.
            
            
              Findings
              – Libraries value teamwork ability, communication ability, interpersonal ability and a good use of data curation tools as the core competences for scientific data specialists. Candidates who possess a second advanced degree, who understand libraries, who hold demonstrated knowledge of metadata standards, and who emphasize details, under the same condition, are more likely to be considered first. Libraries do not have a unified title for scientific data specialists yet. The current curriculums of iSchools mainly cover research method, data science, data management and data service, data statistic and analysis, data warehouse, information studies and technologies, and so on.
            
            
              Originality/value
              – This unique study explores some required qualifications of science data specialist surveyed by job openings, including the core skills, position requirements, responsibilities of the job, and some qualifications. It also investigates the related curriculum setting of iSchool universities through course descriptions. This study is very useful for curriculum development in Chinese LIS education of scientific data specialists including required core courses and selected electives, and to promote the practice of data service in Chinese academic libraries.},

	abstract = {To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6\% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes—although the greatest effects are in small (n ≤ 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},

However, it remains unclear how it relates to information science within LIS schools. The purpose of this paper is to clarify this issue.,Mission statement and nature of both data science and information science are analyzed by reviewing existing work in the two disciplines and drawing DIKW hierarchy. It looks at the ways in which information science theories bring new insights and shed new light on fundamentals of data science.,Data science and information science are twin disciplines by nature. The mission, task and nature of data science are consistent with those of information science. They greatly overlap and share similar concerns. Furthermore, they can complement each other. LIS school should integrate both sciences and develop organizational ambidexterity. Information science can make unique contributions to data science research, including conception of data, data quality control, data librarianship and theory dualism. Document theory, as a promising direction of unified information science, should be introduced to data science to solve the disciplinary divide.,The results of this paper may contribute to the integration of data science and information science within LIS schools and iSchools. It has particular value for LIS school development and reform in the age of big data.},

Results show that a majority of iSchools examined (37 out of 65, 56.9\%) currently offer some form of data-related education, particularly at the master’s level, and that approximately 15\% of their formal degree offerings have a data focus. Overall, iSchools have a greater emphasis on data science and big data analytics, with only a few programmes providing focused curricula in the area of digital curation. Recommendations are made for iSchools to leverage the interdisciplinary nature of information science, publish curricula and track graduate success so that iSchools may excel in educating information professionals in the data area. Future data education in iSchools may benefit from further interdisciplinary data education, including data curation curricula.},

We also argue that the individuals tasked with developing data science courses should not only have statistical training, but also have experience analyzing data with the main objective of solving real-world problems. Here, we share a set of general principles and offer a detailed guide derived from our successful experience developing and teaching a graduate-level, introductory data science course centered entirely on case studies. We argue for the importance of statistical thinking, as defined by Wild and Pfannkuch (1999) and describe how our approach teaches students three key skills needed to succeed in data science, which we refer to as creating, connecting, and computing.

While a few frameworks for systematically exploring the aﬀordances and constraints of such tools exist, most work has only explored one or a few tools at once, or has not focused on K-12 usage. In this paper, we blend ﬁrst-hand comparative analysis methods and supplemental literature review to conduct a systematic analysis of several common data analysis software packages in use at the K12 level. Using an adaptation of a framework proposed by McNamara (2019), we grouped the tools into related genres. Spreadsheets, while familiar and accessible to many, lacked many desirable features. Visual tools (e.g., CODAP, Social Explorer, iNZight) lower the barrier for data exploration, but may not easily support more advanced statistical tests. Scripting tools (e.g., Python, Pyret, R) provide great ﬂexibility but with increased degree of diﬃculty. Looking across tools and genres, our analysis suggests that these genres boast complementary strengths depending on students’ developmental and investigative needs. We make recommendations for the design and use of tools, notably highlighting the importance of working across diﬀerent tool types as a part of data practice.},

Storytellers, especially online journalists, have increasingly been integrating visualizations into their narratives, in some cases allowing the visualization to function in place of a written story. In this paper, we systematically review the design space of this emerging class of visualizations. Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, we identify distinct genres of narrative visualization. We characterize these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the narrative ﬂow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration). Our framework suggests design strategies for narrative visualization, including promising under-explored approaches to journalistic storytelling and educational media.},

	abstract = {Today's organizations, including online businesses, use the art of data-driven decision-making i.e. business-intelligence (BI) to benefit from all the data out in the open. Given the current market demand for BI skill-sets, including the knowledge of different sources and tools for data-collection plus processing, today’s youth need a basic understanding of data-driven intelligence, and an awareness of big-data related ethics and privacy. However, there has been limited research and development work towards designing an effective educational module in this regard at the K-12 level. We intend to address this particular limitation by presenting a uniquely engaging middleschool learning module based upon a combination of useful topics, like data-mining, predictive-analytics, data-visualization, big-data, ethics and privacy, using the free RapidMiner softwaretool. The novelty of our module lies in the use of a GUI-based visual hands-on platform (RapidMiner), a Hollywood movietheme based educational activity, as well as an added focus on big-data ethics and privacy, and its conceptual mapping to the NSA-GenCyber security-first principles. We discuss and analyze the survey data obtained from over hundred participants through several offerings of our module as an educational workshop through our Google-IgniteCS and NSA-GenCyber programs. The collected learning-analytics data indicate that our module can become a simple yet effective means for introducing data-mining, big-data, ethical and privacy issues, and GenCyber security-first principles at the middle-school level. Our results show prospects of motivating middle-school participants towards further learning of topics in data-science, data-ethics and data-security, which is necessary today in a variety of professions.},

Virtual Biostats Day is a 1–1/4 hr online exposure program that incorporates interactive elements exploring statistical concepts alongside clear descriptions of the field of Biostatistics and the roles and responsibilities of a Biostatistician. Students are also introduced to professional Biostatisticians who describe their journeys from high school to where they are today. This combination of didactic and active learning has engaged students, even in the online environment. We relate our experience in implementing and presenti our program to students and provide a complete toolkit for other Bio/Statistics departments or organizations interested in engaging in similar outreach work.

Presenting the concept of the “New Jim Code,” she shows how a range of discriminatory designs encode inequity by explicitly amplifying racial hierarchies; by ignoring but thereby replicating social divisions; or by aiming to fix racial bias but ultimately doing quite the opposite. Moreover, she makes a compelling case for race itself as a kind of technology, designed to stratify and sanctify social injustice in the architecture of everyday life.This illuminating guide provides conceptual tools for decoding tech promises with sociologically informed skepticism. In doing so, it challenges us to question not only the technologies we are sold but also the ones we ourselves manufacture.},

	abstract = {Researchers are used to being evaluated: publications, hiring, tenure and funding decisions are all based on the evaluation of research. Traditionally, this evaluation relied on judgement of peers but, in the light of limited resources and increased bureaucratization of science, peer review is getting more and more replaced or complemented with bibliometric methods. Central to the introduction of bibliometrics in research evaluation was the creation of the Science Citation Index (SCI) in the 1960s, a citation database initially developed for the retrieval of scientific information. Embedded in this database was the Impact Factor, first used as a tool for the selection of journals to cover in the SCI, which then became a synonym for journal quality and academic prestige. Over the last 10 years, this indicator became powerful enough to influence researchers’ publication patterns in so far as it became one of the most important criteria to select a publication venue. Regardless of its many flaws as a journal metric and its inadequacy as a predictor of citations on the paper level, it became the go-to indicator of research quality and was used and misused by authors, editors, publishers and research policy makers alike. The h-index, introduced as an indicator of both output and impact combined in one simple number, has experienced a similar fate, mainly due to simplicity and availability. Despite their massive use, these measures are too simple to capture the complexity and multiple dimensions of research output and impact. This chapter provides an overview of bibliometric methods, from the development of citation indexing as a tool for information retrieval to its application in research evaluation, and discusses their misuse and effects on researchers’ scholarly communication behavior.},

	abstract = {A new way of thinking about data science and data ethics that is informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism.Today, data science is a form of power. It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought.Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever “speak for themselves.”Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed.},

In these positions, they are expected to understand how to use databases and other data warehouses, scrape data from Internet sources, program solutions to complex problems in multiple languages, and think algorithmically as well as statistically. These data science topics have not traditionally been a major component of undergraduate programs in statistics. Consequently, a curricular shift is needed to address additional learning outcomes. The goal of this article is to motivate the importance of data science proficiency and to provide examples and resources for instructors to implement data science in their own statistics curricula. We provide case studies from seven institutions. These varied approaches to teaching data science demonstrate curricular innovations to address new needs. Also included here are examples of assignments designed for courses that foster engagement of undergraduates with data and data science.},

But as I have watched mathematical statistics evolve, I have had cause to wonder and to doubt.

All in all, I have come to feel that my central interest is in data analysis, which I take to include, among other things: procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data.},

We then present a Data Science Knowledge Framework, that we believe can support industry standardization and building measurement and assessment methodologies for data science professionals.},

            A growing number of teaching materials invite students to discuss the complex mathematical, contextual and social aspects of data visualizations. Orchestrating such discussions can be difficult, as this requires teachers to balance a variety of learning goals and student perspectives. This paper examines how teachers interact with data visualization discussion tasks—specifically, those that engage visualizations’ social complexities—as they consider using them in their own classrooms. Drawing from semi-structured clinical interviews with six U.S.-based teachers as they reviewed discussion tasks called Data Story Bytes, we explore: How did these teachers envision using these data visualization discussions in their classrooms? And, What mathematical, contextual, and/or social aspects of visualizations did teachers emphasize when engaging with the discussion task materials? We found that all teachers envisioned using data visualization discussions as lesson openers or routine activities, but they differed in their overall emphasis on the visualizations’ mathematical, contextual, or social aspects. Despite these differences, certain types of discussion prompts were associated with particular response patterns across all teachers, suggesting these task structures can help guide teachers to address a shared set of intended baseline goals for all three of these dimensions. Our findings represent a first step in understanding whether and how socially-oriented data discussion materials may be enacted in classrooms, and what additional design features and supports may be needed to help teachers do so productively.},

Now, the appearance of dual pen-and-keyboard computing devices in the university classroom, notably Tablet PCs, motivates thinking critically about how different expressive modalities could improve in-class student problem -solving and communication.This paper describes the use of Ubiquitous Presenter 2.0 in a study to discover the driving issues of multimodality for both in-class technologies and student exercises. This paper sensitizes instructors to the issues of modality and makes specific recommendations for application design. We find that the choice of modality is not merely one of efficiency or naturalness, but is loaded with numerous personal, social, and material considerations. Although use of the pen (over typed text) is generally preferred, we find that choice itself is critical to encouraging student creativity, collaboration, and communication.},

The analyses found increasing diversity of the PBL knowledge base with respect to both geographical, subject area origins, and focus of the research when compared with findings reported in past reviews. Author co-citation analysis visualized the intellectual structure of this recent PBL literature revealing four dominant schools of thought: Interdisciplinary PBL Theory and Practice, Active Learning, Social and Experiential Learning, PBL Process. This finding highlights the increasing integration of PBL with other methods of experiential and active learning.},

	abstract = {Background. Simulation-based learning (SBL) has been applied and studied in educational settings for at least six decades. While numerous reviews of research have been conducted from different perspectives, none to date have used bibliometric methods to analyze the evolution of simulation-based learning as a ?knowledge base?.Aim. The review sought to document the growth and geographic distribution of research on SBL. In addition, the review aimed to identify key authors and documents, and analyze the intellectual structure of this knowledge base. Finally, the review highlighted emerging topics in this literature.Method. The authors identified 2,812 Scopus-indexed SBL documents published between 1965 and 2018. Bibliographic data were exported from Scopus and analyzed using VOSviewer software. Analyses included descriptive statistics, citation and co-citation analysis, and keyword co-occurrence analysis.Results. The review found a rapidly increasing publication trajectory with 90\% of the literature published since 2000. Although SBL studies have been authored in 94 different countries, the literature is concentrated in Anglo-American-European societies. The review found that the intellectual structure of this knowledge base is comprised of four schools of thought encompassing research on SBL in management education, medical education, technology-enhanced SBL, and learning theories in SBL. Another notable finding was that SBL researchers in medical and management education have progressed on parallel tracks leading to the balkanization on knowledge. Surprisingly, the conceptual core of the field is located in the school of thought associated with learning theories in SBL. This implies that SBL is a subfield of education rather than a discipline in and of itself. Emerging topics that have attracted scholars writing on SBL in recent years are identified and implications for future research discussed.},

However, to truly meet the vision of the GAISE II report and to support all students in developing data literacy for today’s societies, significant transformations need to be made to the educational system as a whole to build capacity for such development. In this article we discuss the current state of the K–12 curriculum focusing on the mathematics curriculum where statistics and data concepts are most frequently situated, presenting some challenges and exciting examples. We then discuss areas of need for capacity building that must come at all levels, including: K–12 school curriculum, K–12 teacher professional development, K–12 teacher preparation, statistics and data science education research, and policies. We also provide a set of recommendations for building capacity to develop the data literacy of all students through the teaching of data science and statistics concepts and practices in the K–12 mathematics curriculum to support democratic equity through engaged citizenship.},

	abstract = {The use of scientific investigation tools for education is receiving considerable attention as a result of an increased emphasis in the educational community on open-ended inquiry. The scientific community possesses a treasure trove of tools that could be adapted for use by learners. Scientific visualization technologies, in particular, offer great promise for education because of the way they use visual representations to facilitate exploration of complex data. However, the tools that are used by scientists are inappropriate for learners because of their reliance on the tacit knowledge of expert users. Through a careful consideration of the differences between scientists and science students and the design of a series of scientific visualization environments for learners in grades 8–16, we have developed a design framework for the creation of scientific investigation tools based on those of scientists. The framework highlights five critical issues for the construction of tools to support inquiry-based learning: motivating context, learner-appropriate activities, data selection, scaffolding interfaces and support for learning. We have applied this framework to the design of ClimateWatcher, a scientific visualization environment for the investigation of issues related to global climate and climate change that is now in use in middle school, high school and university settings.},

	abstract = {A substantial fraction of students who complete their college education at a public university in the United States begin their journey at one of the 935 public 2-year colleges. While the number of 4-year colleges offering bachelor’s degrees in data science continues to increase, data science instruction at many 2-year colleges lags behind. A major impediment is the relative paucity of introductory data science courses that serve multiple student audiences and can easily transfer. In addition, the lack of predefined transfer pathways (or articulation agreements) for data science creates a growing disconnect that leaves students who want to study data science at a disadvantage. We describe opportunities and barriers to data science transfer pathways. Five points of curricular friction merit attention: 1) a first course in data science, 2) a second course in data science, 3) a course in scientific computing, data science workflow, and/or reproducible computing, 4) lab sciences, and 5) navigating communication, ethics, and application domain requirements in the context of general education and liberal arts course mappings. We catalog existing transfer pathways, efforts to align curricula across institutions, obstacles to overcome with minimally disruptive solutions, and approaches to foster these pathways. Improvements in these areas are critically important to ensure that a broad and diverse set of students are able to engage and succeed in undergraduate data science programs.},

In order to participate as a responsible citizen, it is essential to have a solid grounding in reasoning about data. Reasoning about data is a fundamental human activity; its components can be found in nearly every profession and in most school curricula in the world. This chapter reviews past and recent research on reasoning about data across all ages of learners from primary school to adults. Specifically in this chapter, the term reasoning about data is defined, the implementation of reasoning about data in the curricula of different countries is investigated, and research studies of learner reasoning about distribution, variation, comparing groups, and association, which are fundamental concepts when reasoning about data, are reviewed. The research review presented includes references to existing frameworks and taxonomies that can assess learner reasoning in regard to these concepts and discusses the influence of digital tools to enhance learner statistical reasoning. Finally, some insights for future directions in research about reasoning about data are provided.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the discipline of statistics has begun reckoning with its difficult history. Institutions are reconsidering names that have honored key historical figures in statistics who have deep ties to eugenics movements and racial and class prejudice. These names, however, continue to appear in our classrooms, where we teach the methods created by these individuals, raising the question of how instructors should address their legacies. Three examples of famous statisticians and their work—Francis Galton’s use of conditional probabilities to demonstrate “hereditary talent,” Karl Pearson’s attempt to quantify the intelligence of Jewish immigrant students, and Ronald A. Fisher’s creation of the analysis of variance to de-emphasize environment in human development—highlight the intimate ties between statistics and eugenics. These examples, along with a discussion of the context of these men, eugenics movements, and the statisticians and scientists who opposed their eugenic programs, can humanize the field for students, teach them about the challenges in accurate and unbiased data collection and analysis, and connect historical mistakes to contemporary ethical issues. Confronting this history in the classroom can both improve the teaching of the statistical methodologies themselves and begin a broader conversation about the role of statistics in the world.

This poster presents core design principles devised by the authors to build a data science curriculum foregrounding ethics and valuing creative human capacities alongside strong data analytic skills. The curriculum design transforms human‐centered principles into practice. The poster visually illustrates the trajectory of these principles in relation to three specific graduate attributes, using a selection of deep dives into the learning design. To illustrate the specific power information theory and practice has to shape data science training, the poster uses evocative quotes from information science theorists and displays how their work significantly influenced the overall philosophy of the program, student activities and assessments. Using ‘gamestorming’ techniques during the poster session, the audience is invited to contribute further insights about ways to nurture the deeply human capacities of the data scientists we train.},

	abstract = {Even though working with data is as important as coding for understanding and dealing with complex problems across multiple fields, it has received very little attention in the context of Computational Thinking. This paper discusses an approach for bridging the gap between Computational Thinking with Data Science by employing and studying classification as a higher-order thinking process that connects the two. To achieve that, we designed and developed an online constructionist gaming tool called SorBET which integrates coding and database design enabling students to interpret, organize, and analyze data through game play and game design. The paper presents and discusses the results of a pilot study that aimed to investigate the data practices secondary students develop through playing and modifying SorBET games, and to determine the impact of game modding on student critical engagement with CT. According to the results, students developed and used certain data practices such as data interpretation and data model design to become better players or to design an interesting classification game. Moreover, game modding process motivated students to question the original games’ content, leading them to develop a critical stance towards the game data model and representations.},

Engaging these tensions, we offer a framework of student objectives for learning about Big Data with mobile technologies.

The research trend in computer science education was analysed using publications from the Scopus-indexed database between 1970 and 2021. This study aims to summarize this information to assist three groups of stakeholders: educators, researchers and policymakers. Our review goal to document and analyse the trends in CSE research publications for teaching and learning. A total of 800 publications were derived for further assessment based on computer science education in the article title with multiple tools. We used, Microsoft Excel, VOSviewer and Harzing’s Publish or Perish were utilized for frequency analysis data visualization and citation metrics and assessment. The study outcomes were documented with standard bibliometric indicators: publication growth, authorship trends, collaboration, prolific authors, national contribution, most active establishments, top-cited articles, preferred journals, intellectual structure and topical trends. Resultantly, CSE research publications have perpetually grown for the past 51 years since 1970 with the United States highlighting the largest study contributor, followed by Germany and the United Kingdom. The ACM SIGCSE Bulletin published the highest number of CSE research publications. The analysis of the cluster on topical trends indicates that curriculum design and implementation (e.g., assessment, broadening participation), elements of teaching and learning (e.g., constructivism, e-learning, game-based learning) and other areas of interest comprise pedagogical approach (e.g., computational thinking, k-12 education, motivation). Based on the research results, we expand on the findings and propose how authors might enhance the CSE function in curriculum design, implementation and shifts could eventually substitute past study clusters.},

As experts have repeatedly stressed in recent years, science education plays an important role in developing scientifically literate societies. In this context, it is critical to consider which subjects science educators frequently concentrate on and the messages they give to researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to use bibliometric data to understand the topics that the articles in the Journal of Research in Science Teaching (JRST), one of the flagship journals about science education and teaching, focused on over the last 20 years. This study employed both descriptive and bibliometric analysis. Based on data from the Web of Science (WoS), descriptive analyses are presented as frequencies and percentages and we used VOSviewer software for bibliometric analysis. Findings showed that more than 80\% of the authors of the JRST are from the United States, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Moreover, results of these analyses demonstrate that the researchers publishing in the JRST focused on two main ideas over the past 20 years: “Which science teaching methods and strategies are most effective?” and “What can be done to make science teaching more inclusive?” As a result, it can be clearly seen that JRST has special attention on inclusive approach in science education which should be designed to include traditionally underrepresented groups.},

A total of 276 articles retrieved from the Scopus database were analyzed and visualized through the Bibliometrix analysis package from R and VOSviewer software. The finding shows that since 2009, CT has been the subject of mathematics learning research, which has grown significantly since 2013. Regarding total publication in CT, Education and Information Technologies contributes as the most productive journal, and the United States places first among all countries. The article ‘computational thinking’ appears as the most widely referenced source. Moreover, the frequent topics network with CT are the integration of CT with programming, STEM, and coding. This result is analyzed further by the thematic evolution map showing CT research in STEM education, including mathematics, exhibits promising prospects for future development.},

	abstract = {Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

	abstract = {To reconstruct topics in bibliometric networks, one must use algorithms. Specifically, researchers often apply algorithms from the class of network community detection algorithms (such as the Louvain algorithm) that are general-purpose algorithms not intentionally programmed for a bibliometric task. Each algorithm has specific properties “inscribed,” which distinguish it from the others. It can thus be assumed that different algorithms are more or less suitable for a given bibliometric task. However, the suitability of a specific algorithm when it is applied for topic reconstruction is rarely reflected upon. Why choose this algorithm and not another? In this study, I assess the suitability of four community detection algorithms for topic reconstruction, by first deriving the properties of the phenomenon to be reconstructed—topics—and comparing if these match with the properties of the algorithms. The results suggest that the previous use of these algorithms for bibliometric purposes cannot be justified by their specific suitability for this task.},

The process has four main components: formulate questions, collect data, analyze data, and interpret results. The Pre-K-12 Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between a question that anticipates a deterministic answer and a question that anticipates an answer based on data that will vary, referred to as a statistical question. This article expands upon the Pre-K-12 GAISE distinction of a statistical question by addressing and identifying the different types of statistical questions used across the four components of the statistical problem-solving process and the importance of interrogating these different statistical question types. Since the publication of the original Pre-K-12 GAISE document, research has helped to clarify the purposes of questioning at each component of the process, to clarify the language of questioning, and to develop criteria for answering the question, “What makes a good statistical question?”},

Students majoring in Data Analytics complete four or more mathematics and computer science courses, four project-oriented Data Analytics courses, three to four courses in one of seven applied domains, and a required summer internship. Data Analytics courses are taught by both dedicated Data Analytics faculty and other faculty from the Committee. Partnerships with campus offices, alumni, businesses, and nonprofits have enhanced both coursework and internship opportunities.

	abstract = {The Gears of My Childhood Before I was two years old I had developed an intense involvement with automobiles. The names of car parts made up a very substantial portion of my vocabulary: I was particularly proud of knowing about the parts of the transmission system, the gearbox, and most especially the differential. It was, of course, many years later before I understood how gears work; but once I did, playing with gears became a favorite pastime. I loved rotating circular objects against one another in gearlike motions and, naturally, my first "erector set" project was a crude gear system. I became adept at turning wheels in my head and at making chains of cause and effect: "This one turns this way so that must turn that way so . . . " I found particular pleasure in such systems as the differential gear, which does not follow a simple linear chain of causality since the motion in the transmission shaft can be distributed in many different ways to the two wheels depending on what resistance they encounter. I remember quite vividly my excitement at discovering that a system could be lawful and completely comprehensible without being rigidly deterministic. I believe that working with differentials did more for my mathematical development than anything I was taught in elementary school. Gears, serving as models, carried many otherwise abstract ideas into my head. I clearly remember two examples from school math. I saw multiplication tables as gears, and my first brush with equations in two variables (e.g., 3x + 4y = 10) immediately evoked the differential. By the time I had made a mental gear model of the relation between x and y, figuring how many teeth each gear needed, the equation had become a comfortable friend. Many years later when I read Piaget this incident served me as a model for his notion of assimilation, except I was immediately struck by the fact that his discussion does not do full justice to his own idea. He talks almost entirely about cognitive aspects of assimilation. But there is also an affective component. Assimilating equations to gears certainly is a powerful way to bring old knowledge to bear on a new object. But it does more as well. I am sure that such assimilations helped to endow mathematics, for me, with a positive affective tone that can be traced back to my infantile experiences with cars. I believe Piaget really agrees. As I came to know him personally I understood that his neglect of the affective comes more from a modest sense that little is known about it than from an arrogant sense of its irrelevance. But let me return to my childhood. One day I was surprised to discover that some adults---even most adults---did not understand or even care about the magic of the gears. I no longer think much about gears, but I have never turned away from the questions that started with that discovery: How could what was so simple for me be incomprehensible to other people? My proud father suggested "being clever" as an explanation. But I was painfully aware that some people who could not understand the differential could easily do things I found much more difficult. Slowly I began to formulate what I still consider the fundamental fact about learning: Anything is easy if you can assimilate it to your collection of models. If you can't, anything can be painfully difficult. Here too I was developing a way of thinking that would be resonant with Piaget's. The understanding of learning must be genetic. It must refer to the genesis of knowledge. What an individual can learn, and how he learns it, depends on what models he has available. This raises, recursively, the question of how he learned these models. Thus the "laws of learning" must be about how intellectual structures grow out of one another and about how, in the process, they acquire both logical and emotional form. This book is an exercise in an applied genetic epistemology expanded beyond Piaget's cognitive emphasis to include a concern with the affective. It develops a new perspective for education research focused on creating the conditions under which intellectual models will take root. For the last two decades this is what I have been trying to do. And in doing so I find myself frequently reminded of several aspects of my encounter with the differential gear. First, I remember that no one told me to learn about differential gears. Second, I remember that there was feeling, love, as well as understanding in my relationship with gears. Third, I remember that my first encounter with them was in my second year. If any "scientific" educational psychologist had tried to "measure" the effects of this encounter, he would probably have failed. It had profound consequences but, I conjecture, only very many years later. A "pre- and post-" test at age two would have missed them. Piaget's work gave me a new framework for looking at the gears of my childhood. The gear can be used to illustrate many powerful "advanced" mathematical ideas, such as groups or relative motion. But it does more than this. As well as connecting with the formal knowledge of mathematics, it also connects with the "body knowledge," the sensorimotor schemata of a child. You can be the gear, you can understand how it turns by projecting yourself into its place and turning with it. It is this double relationship---both abstract and sensory---that gives the gear the power to carry powerful mathematics into the mind. In a terminology I shall develop in later chapters, the gear acts here as a transitional object. A modern-day Montessori might propose, if convinced by my story, to create a gear set for children. Thus every child might have the experience I had. But to hope for this would be to miss the essence of the story. I fell in love with the gears. This is something that cannot be reduced to purely "cognitive" terms. Something very personal happened, and one cannot assume that it would be repeated for other children in exactly the same form. My thesis could be summarized as: What the gears cannot do the computer might. The computer is the Proteus of machines. Its essence is its universality, its power to simulate. Because it can take on a thousand forms and can serve a thousand functions, it can appeal to a thousand tastes. This book is the result of my own attempts over the past decade to turn computers into instruments flexible enough so that many children can each create for themselves something like what the gears were for me.},

The divided cross-system governance situation is particularly problematic for students who attend the nation's broad or open access institutions, and especially for community college-bound students. The origin of the disconnect between K–12 and higher education in the United States stemmed, in part, from the way the nation created education systems to deliver curriculum for both K–12 and higher education.},

We discuss two contrasting visions for data science among our research participants. One vision is a transdisciplinary view portraying data science as a phenomenon with transcendent, appropriative, and impositional qualities that sits apart from academic domains. Another view of data science—one that was far more prevalent among our research subjects—casts data science as grounded, relational, and adaptive, emerging from crosspollination of numerous academic domains. We argue that this latter formulation represents a more quotidian reality of data science and positions the field as an extradiscipline, defined as a field that exists to facilitate the exchange of knowledge, skills, tools, and methods from an indeterminate and fluctuating set of disciplinary perspectives while conserving the boundaries of those disciplines. We argue that the dueling transdisciplinary and extradisciplinary visions for data science have important implications for how the field will mature, and that the extradiscipline concept opens novel directions for studying academic knowledge production in STS, contributing additional precision to the literature on disciplinarity and its permutations.},

We also provide six examples of data science ethics modules used in five different courses at our liberal arts college, each focusing on a different ethical consideration. The modules are designed to be portable such that they can be flexibly incorporated into existing courses at different levels of instruction with minimal disruption to syllabi.

	abstract = {Data visualizations have proliferated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to communicate information about the crisis and influence policy development and individual decision-making. In invoking exponential growth, mathematical modelling, statistical analysis, and the like, these data visualizations invite opportunities for mathematics teaching and learning. Yet data visualizations are social texts, authored from specific points of view, that narrate particular, and often consequential, stories. Their fundamental reliance on quantification and mathematics cements their social positioning as supposedly objective, reliable, and neutral. The reading of any data visualization demands unpacking the role of mathematics, including how data and variables have been formatted and how relationships are framed to narrate stories from particular points of view. We present an approach to a critical reading of data visualizations for the context of mathematics education that draws on three interrelated concepts: mathematical formatting (what gets quantified, measured, and how), framing (how variables are related and through what kind of data visualization), and narrating (which stories the data visualization tells, its potential impacts and limits). This approach to reading data visualisations includes a process of reimagining through reformatting, reframing and renarrating. We illustrate this approach and these three concepts using data visualizations published in the New York Times in 2020 about COVID-19. We offer a set of possible questions to guide a critical reading of data visualizations, beyond this set of examples.},

These views are reflected, in particular, in the introduction of exploratory data analysis (EDA) into the statistics curriculum. Then, a detailed example of EDA learning activity in the middle school is introduced, which makes use of the power of the spreadsheet to mediate students' construction of meanings for statistical conceptions. Through this example, I endeavor to illustrate how an attempt at serious integration of computers in teaching and learning statistics brings about a cascade of changes in curriculum materials, classroom praxis, and students' ways of learning. A theoretical discussion follows that underpins the impact of technological tools on teaching and learning statistics by emphasizing how the computer lends itself to supporting cognitive and sociocultural processes. Subsequently, I present a sample of educational technologies, which represents the sorts of software that have typically been used in statistics instruction: statistical packages (tools), microworlds, tutorials, resources (including Internet resources), and teachers' metatools. Finally, certain implications and recommendations for the use of computers in the statistical educational milieu are suggested.},

The urgency of updating education's goals and methods recommends an activist research paradigm: to simultaneously create and study changes in processes and outcomes of human learning with new cognitive and educational tools.},

Since then, the pace of software development has accelerated, advancements in computing and data science have moved the goalposts, and it is time to reassess. Software continues to be developed to help do and learn statistics, but there is little critical evaluation of the resulting tools, and no accepted framework with which to critique them. This article presents a set of attributes necessary for a modern statistical computing tool. The framework was designed to be broadly applicable to both novice and expert users, with a particular focus on making more supportive statistical computing environments. A modern statistical computing tool should be accessible, provide easy entry, privilege data as a first-order object, support exploratory and confirmatory analysis, allow for flexible plot creation, support randomization, be interactive, include inherent documentation, support narrative, publishing, and reproducibility, and be flexible to extensions. Ideally, all these attributes could be incorporated into one tool, supporting users at all levels, but a more reasonable goal is for tools designed for novices and professionals to “reach across the gap,” taking inspiration from each others’ strengths.},

Next, an overview of various types of technological tools highlights their benefits, purposes and limitations for developing students’ statistical reasoning. We further discuss different learning environments that capitalize on these tools with examples from research and practice. Dynamic data analysis software applications for secondary students such as Fathom and TinkerPlots are discussed in detail. Examples are provided to illustrate innovative uses of technology. In the future, these uses may also be supported by a wider range of new tools still to be developed. To summarize some of the findings, the role of digital technologies in statistical reasoning is metaphorically compared with travelling between data and conclusions, where these tools represent fast modes of transport.

The many affordances that technological advances offer to teachers of statistics and the issues that hinder their widespread use in classrooms are summarised.

It seems that pedagogic developments have not kept pace with those in software design, in that the opportunity to use computers to engage students in the full statistical enquiry cycle is not being exploited.

This paper describes a unique co-created citizen science project, WeatherBlur, which brought fishermen, elementary students, and teachers from island and coastal communities together with research scientists via an online platform to share, analyze, and interpret data about the local impact of climate change. The project was designed utilizing a sociocultural learning approach that integrated communities of practice, knowledge building, funds of knowledge, and place-based education theory. The study aimed to understand how scientists, community members, and students interact to promote learning and collaboration within an online learning community. In addition, the study addressed the impact of the program on elementary student learning outcomes in earth science and graph interpretation. Data analyses suggest that the model implemented provided a high level of interactivity across all ages and groups, and increased students’ understanding of earth science and skills in graph interpretation.

The tools used to teach data science play a central role in shaping the learning experience. Therefore, it is important to carefully choose which tools to use to introduce learners to data science. This article presents a systematic analysis of 30 data science tools that are, or designed to be, used in introductory data science education for K-12 students. The identified tools list includes spreadsheets, visual analysis tools, and scripting environments. For each tool, we examine facets of its capabilities, interactions, educational support, and accessibility. For block-based programming tools, we also examine the data science functionalities available in that tool’s blocks.

Our approach to helping students build expertise with complex information leverages activity theory to think about the design of a classroom activity system integrated with the design of a collaborative open-source network-analysis software tool called Net.Create. Through analysis of network log data as well as video data of students’ collaborative interactions with Net.Create, we explore how our activity system helped students reconcile common contradictions that create barriers to dealing with complex datasets in large lecture classrooms. Findings show that as students draw on details in a historical text to collaboratively construct a larger network, they begin to move more readily between small detail and aggregate overview. Students at both high and low initial skill levels were able to increase the complexity of their historical analyses through their engagement with the Net.Create tool and activities. Net.Create transforms the limitation of large class sizes in history classrooms into a resource for students’ collaborative knowledge building, and through collaborative data entry it supports the historiographic practices of citation and revision and helps students embed local historical actors into a larger historical context.},

In these activities, participants created a visualization (network graph) from multivariate data, encoded raw data for several attributes from visualizations depicting multivariate relationships, and structured data into a tidy format. With minimal instruction, participants were able to create visualizations when given data representing multivariate relationships. They were also able to structure non-tidy data into a tidy format with some scaffolding and discussion. Notably, creating data tables from visualizations, especially relational tables, seemed more challenging for them. These results provide insight into secondary teachers’ reasoning about connections between multivariate data and visualization.},

Our goal was to shed light on students' understanding of text as data using a motivating task to classify headlines as “clickbait” or “news.” Three types of features (function, content, and form) surfaced, the majority from the first scenario. Our analysis of the interviews indicates that this sequence of activities engaged the participants in thinking at both the human-perception level and the computer-extraction level and conceptualizing connections between them.},

	abstract = {Although research regarding teaching probability distributions from a modelling perspective is in its infancy, teachers in New Zealand have been required to teach new data-driven approaches alongside more established theory-driven approaches since 2013. A review of documents produced to support teaching probability distributions from a modelling perspective led to the identification of a potential problem with the current method taught to Year 13 students in New Zealand for informally testing the fit of a probability distribution model. Therefore, this study focused on how teachers informally test the fit of a probability distribution model. Seventeen teachers participated in a task-based interview consisting of six tasks, one of which was a randomised experiment. The teachers’ responses were analysed using thematic analysis. The analysis produced categories of criteria for sketching distribution shape and for testing the fit of a probability distribution model. Structural analysis based on a statistical modelling framework proposed by the researcher was employed to identify key knowledge components used and connected by teachers when probability distribution modelling. The findings of this study suggest that the main issues with informally testing the fit of a probability distribution model are the lack of criteria for considering (1) sample size and (2) the expected variation of sample proportions. Both criteria are difficult for teachers to take into account without using a formal test for significance. Teachers also struggled to separate the real world from the model world in their thinking about probability distribution modelling, appearing to conceive of only two components: model and data. The researcher’s new informal test for the fit of a probability distribution model incorporates sample size and the expected variation of sample proportions within her simulation-based modelling visualisation tool. The tool reinforces the separation and connection of the real world and the model world through the use of the researcher’s statistical modelling framework.},

This build-it-yourself process is more transparent than using algorithms such as CART; we believe it will help students not only understand the fundamentals of trees, but also better understand tree-building algorithms when they do encounter them. And because classification is an important task in machine learning, a good foundation in trees can prepare students to better understand that emerging and important field. We also describe a free online tool—Arbor—that students can use to do this, and note some implications for instruction.},

	abstract = {We report on our work with students in our data science courses, focusing on the analysis of students' results. This study represents an in-depth analysis of students' creation and documentation of machine learning models. The students were supported by educationally designed Jupyter Notebooks, which are used as worked examples. Using the worked example, students document their results in a so-called computational essay. We examine which aspects of creating computational essays are difficult for students to find out how worked examples should be designed to support students without being too prescriptive. We analyze the computational essays produced by students and draw consequences for redesigning our worked example. INTRODUCTION Every day, we are surrounded by by-products of data science and especially artificial intelligence (AI) models created by using machine learning (ML) methods. These contents have emerged as new topics in today's school curricula (Bargagliotti et al., 2020; International Data Science in Schools Project Curriculum Team, 2019). Because of this new meaning of ML methods in our everyday lives, it is important for students to understand how ML algorithms are constructed and the roles that data and data explorations play in this context. This means that appropriate methods and tools are needed to make these topics accessible to students. An important feature a tool for this purpose needs to provide is the possibility of documenting insights into the creation of the AI tools and insights that arise from data analyses to reexamine them at a later time. In the Project Data science and Big Data in School (ProDaBi, www.prodabi.de/en) project, we are developing teaching modules, together with respective tools that students can use to get engaged with data and machine learning models. Findings by Fleischer et al. (2022) as well as by Hüsing and Podworny (2022) indicate that creating computational essays is a promising method to let students do data explorations and create data-based decision models while documenting them in the same document. Besides programming and writing code, this approach explicitly integrates documenting and explaining a (programming-) procedure as well as its results. Hence, there is a need for a programming environment that makes it possible to split program code into small snippets while also integrating comments and pictures. For this purpose, we use Jupyter Notebooks (JNB) (Kluyver et al., 2016; Perez \& Granger, 2015) because these allow combining Python-code-cells (for writing code) and text cells (for annotations and explanations). Because creating a computational essay is a complex task, students are offered a "working blueprint" to get an idea of how the process of applying an ML method for creating a data-based decision model can be documented appropriately. Using worked examples in this sense lets students work independently by providing them with related examples as a scaffold, from which the students can create their own products. Metaphorically speaking, students are encouraged to "glu[e] together" (Ko et al., 2011, p. 21:16) certain existing elements and features. To let worked examples appear as scaffolds for creating individual products, it must be determined which elements they should contain and what forms of assistance need to be provided. Building on insights regarding the use of worked examples in order to create computational essays (Fleischer et al., 2022), in this paper, we want to analyze difficulties in creating computational essays guided by worked examples. We want to investigate how worked examples can be designed to support the creation of computational essays for data exploration and machine learning processes. BACKGROUND The Concept of a Computational Essay The term, computational essay, was initially introduced by diSessa (2000, p. 185) as an essay consisting of programming code, producing content for the reader to play with, and integrated explanatory components such as text, hypertext, diagrams, and pictures. This format is described to be ideal for presenting scientific insights (especially for students) or instructing how to solve a task requiring programming and visualizations. McNamara (2019) supports this idea when arguing for the},

Reading and Writing the World with Mathematics argues that mathematics education should prepare students to investigate and critique injustice, and to challenge, in words and actions, oppressive structures and acts. Based on teacher-research, the book provides a theoretical framework and practical examples for how mathematics educators can connect schooling to a larger sociopolitical context and concretely teach mathematics for social justice.},

NWFAR adds three practices that are typically not emphasized in learning designs for DS: feel?engaging emotions and the physical body; act?challenging, inspiring, or informing others towards change; and reimagine?envisioning how data, data methods, and data technologies could pursue different problems, solutions, and perspectives. We illustrate NWFAR through two design-based research projects from prior empirical work. Through these two examples, we demonstrate what thinking with NWFAR could look like in practice and highlight future possibilities for learning.

	url = {https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1mm9303x},
	abstract = {Computers have changed the way we think about data and data analysis. While statistical programming tools have attempted to keep pace with these developments, there is room for improvement in interactivity, randomization methods, and reproducible research.In addition, as in many disciplines, statistical novices tend to have a reduced experience of the true practice. This dissertation discusses the gap between tools for teaching statistics (like TinkerPlots, Fathom, and web applets) and tools for doing statistics (like SAS, SPSS, or R). We posit this gap should not exist, and provide some suggestions for bridging it. Methods for this bridge can be curricular or technological, although this work focuses primarily on the technological.We provide a list of attributes for a modern data analysis tool to support novices through the entire learning-to-doing trajectory. These attributes include easy entry for novice users, data as a first-order persistent object, support for a cycle of exploratory and confirmatory analysis, flexible plot creation, support for randomization throughout, interactivity at every level, inherent visual documentation, simple support for narrative, publishing, and reproducibility, and flexibility to build extensions.While this ideal data analysis tool is still a few years in the future, we describe several projects attempting to close the gap between tools for learning and tools for doing statistics. One is curricular, a high school level Introduction to Data Science curriculum. Others are technological, like the experimental LivelyR interface for interactive analysis, the MobilizeSimple R package, and Shiny microworlds.Much of this work was inspired by Biehler (1997), which describes the attributes necessary for a software package for learning statistics. Biehler’s vision has largely come to light, but advancements in computing and ‘data science’ have moved the goalposts, and there is more to learning statistics than before. This work envisions a tool not only encompassing these advancements, but providing an extensible system capable of growing with the times.},

In this paper, we argue for an expanded role for this concept of levels in science education. We show confusion of levels (and "slippage" between levels) as the source of many of people's deep misunderstandings about patterns and phenomena in the world. These misunderstandings are evidenced not only in students' difficulties in the formal study of science but also in their misconceptions about experiences in their everyday lives. The StarLogo modeling language is designed as a medium for students to build models of multi-leveled phenomena and through these constructions explore the concept of levels. We describe several case studies of students working in StarLogo. The cases illustrate students' difficulties with the concept of levels, and how they can begin to develop richer understandings.},

	abstract = {Modeling is a core practice in science and a central part of scientific literacy. We present theoretical and empirical motivation for a learning progression for scientific modeling that aims to make the practice accessible and meaningful for learners. We define scientific modeling as including the elements of the practice (constructing, using, evaluating, and revising scientific models) and the metaknowledge that guides and motivates the practice (e.g., understanding the nature and purpose of models). Our learning progression for scientific modeling includes two dimensions that combine metaknowledge and elements of practice—scientific models as tools for predicting and explaining, and models change as understanding improves. We describe levels of progress along these two dimensions of our progression and illustrate them with classroom examples from 5th and 6th graders engaged in modeling. Our illustrations indicate that both groups of learners productively engaged in constructing and revising increasingly accurate models that included powerful explanatory mechanisms, and applied these models to make predictions for closely related phenomena. Furthermore, we show how students engaged in modeling practices move along levels of this progression. In particular, students moved from illustrative to explanatory models, and developed increasingly sophisticated views of the explanatory nature of models, shifting from models as correct or incorrect to models as encompassing explanations for multiple aspects of a target phenomenon. They also developed more nuanced reasons to revise models. Finally, we present challenges for learners in modeling practices—such as understanding how constructing a model can aid their own sensemaking, and seeing model building as a way to generate new knowledge rather than represent what they have already learned. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Navigating this landscape can be challenging, especially for those who are just entering the field or who seek insights from multiple disciplinary communities. This report contributes to a growing body of research that aims to characterize the emerging field of “Data Science Education.” It presents a reference co-citation analysis drawing from 7,000+ works that are cited by papers that explicitly identify themselves in their title, keywords, or abstract as concerned with “data science education”—thus representing the de facto foundations of this field. The structure of the resulting reference co-citation network suggests that while there are some "broker" references that are more broadly cited across the emerging data science education literature, the field is building upon three distinct, conceptually coherent, and rather isolated clusters of literature. These clusters generally focus on Undergraduate Data Science programs, K-12 Data Science, and Computational Approaches to Data for Non-Majors, respectively. I characterize each cluster with attention to the audiences, themes, pedagogies, and methodologies emphasized, and explore the nature of recent data science education papers that draw heavily from each cluster. All three clusters demonstrate attention to student-centered pedagogies, research methodologies that highlight student experience, and ethics and diversity. However, they also evidence important differences in scholarly foundations between undergraduate and K-12 data science education efforts, between data science education efforts for majors versus non-majors, and between K-12 data science initiatives emerging from different groups and disciplines.},

This process of ‘data wrangling’ often constitutes the most tedious and time-consuming aspect of analysis. Though data cleaning and integration arelongstanding issues in the database community, relatively little research has explored how interactive visualization can advance the state of the art. In this article, we review the challenges and opportunities associated with addressing data quality issues. We argue that analysts might more effectively wrangle data through new interactive systems that integrate data verification, transformation, and visualization. We identify a number of outstanding research questions, including how appropriate visual encodings can facilitate apprehension of missing data, discrepant values, and uncertainty; how interactive visualizations might facilitate data transform specification; and how recorded provenance and social interaction might enable wider reuse, verification, and modification of data transformations.},

Our findings demonstrate that, through the process of story co‐narration, family members draw upon and stimulate critical social, cognitive, and linguistic skills that underlie scientific and other scholarly discourse as they jointly construct, deconstruct, and reconstruct theories of everyday events. Each story is potentially a theory of a set of events in that it contains an explanation, which may then be overtly challenged and reworked by co‐narrators. Our data suggest that complex theory‐building through storytelling is promoted by (and constitutive of) interlocutors’ familiarity with one another and/or the narrative events. As such, long before children enter a classroom, everyday storytelling among familiars constitutes a commonplace medium for socializing perspective‐taking, critical thinking, and other intellectual skills that have been viewed as outcomes of formal schooling.},

In this article, we argue that as this educational goal is pursued, it is important to attend to the normative scripts that are often associated with data, and how they relate to learners’ perspectives and prior experiences. We do this by examining two initiatives that aimed to help young people learn about data and its “real-world” applications by engaging them in participatory mapping activities, directed toward the study of local community challenges. We argue that when there are mismatches between students’ realities and how reality is described to work in data science, making the time and space to examine these contradictions can lead to a robust engagement with data science and its applications. These findings have implications for how we might better design tools and learning activities that connect data science with the broader contexts that frame young people’s lives.},

	abstract = {Cutting edge strategies for thinking about data science and data ethics through an intersectional feminist lens.“Without ever finger-wagging, Data Feminism reveals inequities and offers a way out of a broken system in which the numbers are allowed to lie.”—WIREDToday, data science is a form of power. It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought. Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever “speak for themselves.”Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed.},

The instruction highlighted links between data analysis, chance, and modeling in the context of describing and explaining the distributions of measures that result from repeatedly measuring multiple objects (i.e., the height of the school’s flagpole, a teacher’s head circumference, the arm-span of a peer). We describe the variety of data representations, statistics, and models that students invented and how these inscriptions were grounded both in their personal experience as measurers and in the affordances of TinkerPlots, which assisted them in quantifying what they could readily display with the computer tool. By inventing statistics, students explored the relation between qualities of distribution and methods for expressing these qualities as a quantity. Attention to different aspects of distribution resulted in the invention of different statistics. Variable invention invited attention to the qualities of “good” measures (statistics), thus meshing conceptual and procedural knowledge. Students used chance simulations, built into TinkerPlots, to generate models that explained variability in a sample of measurements as a composition of true value and chance error. Error was, in turn, decomposed into a variety of sources and associated magnitudes—a form of analysis of variance for children. The dynamic notations of TinkerPlots altered the conceptual landscape of modeling, placing simulation and world on more equal footing, as first suggested by Kaput (Journal of Mathematical Behavior, 17(2), 265–281, 1998).},

One way to ameliorate these challenges is to put experiments in conversation with other scientific practices. In this chapter, we describe the design of an introductory biology laboratory curriculum in which students conduct investigations using both experiments and computational models. We highlight two ways in which the interaction between these two practices can enrich students’ engagement with experimentation: (1) Comparing the assumptions and patterns that emerge from experiments and models can help students identify questions to motivate experimental design; (2) Attending to the parameters and dynamics in the computational model can help students make sense of experimental data and situate their claims in a broader conceptual context. Our purpose is to inspire educators in the life sciences to consider how putting experiments in conversation with other practices like computational modeling can enrich students’ engagement with experimentation.},

	abstract = {This report characterizes forms of dialogic support that a sixth-grade teacher generated during whole-class and small-group conversations to help students develop a practice of statistical modeling. During four weeks of instruction, students constructed and revised models to account for variability and uncertainty across a variety of random processes, many of which they experienced first-hand. Data sources for the research included field notes and video recordings of classroom conversations involving the teacher. Analyses identified and characterized teacher assistance during classroom episodes in which the teacher fostered the emergence and development of fundamental aspects of statistical modeling practice. These aspects included a) establishing mappings between models of chance and the situations or processes being modeled, b) imagining outcomes as constituents of a long-run random process, c) evaluating model fit, and d) making model-based inferences. Throughout instruction, the teacher systematically helped students coordinate these distinctive aspects of modeling practice. The findings suggest how teacher practices can promote the sustained development of statistical reasoning as a dialogue between data and model, and more generally, how teacher assistance attuned to student thinking about aspects of a disciplinary practice can foster a student-centered phenomenology of that practice.},

Two frameworks for context are used to analyze the classroom dialogue: The data-context used in statistical enquiry and in the formation of statistical concepts and the learning-experience-contexts such as prior statistical knowledge, which can affect the learning process. The analysis tracks the learning of informal inferential reasoning before, during, and after the introduction of sampling variability concepts. Data-context was found to assist learners in finding meaning from observed patterns, but could divert their attention during the construction of concepts and when attempting to apply newly-learned theory. Learning-experience-contexts played a significant role in mediating learners' development of informal inferential reasoning. Implications for developing concepts for informal inferential reasoning and for research are discussed.},

Finding that their sample’s sex ratio was improbable yet consistent with samples in the larger database instigated a search for ecological mechanism.

	abstract = {Understanding how and why systems change over time is a powerful way to make sense of our world. By modeling those systems, learners have the opportunity to consider how their own actions influence that world, and to make predictions and recommendations for the future. But often, the notion of change is as complex as it is powerful – populations, global temperatures, and economic trends all represent multiple events and actors, but are measured in terms of only a few quantities. In this paper, we discuss the motivation and design of DeltaTick, an extension to the NetLogo (Wilensky, 1999) agent-based modeling environment that allows learners to easily construct and analyze models of complex quantitative change. To do so, they define models using agent behavior-based units, rather than the rate-based units typical of equations or systems dynamics models. They can then explore, compare, and annotate model results to investigate how their behavioural models relate to typical equation-based representations.},

	title = {Re-conceiving {Introductory} {Computer} {Science} {Curricula} through {Agent}-{Based} {Modeling}},
	abstract = {We present a preliminary version of the MAICS (MultiAgent Introduction to Computer Science) framework, which is a new approach for revitalizing introductory undergraduate or high school computer science curricula through the deep integration of agent-based modeling (ABM) and multiagent systems (MAS) perspectives. We have developed a suite of educational agent-based models highlighting several key ideas of computer science. We discuss the merits of using multi-agent systems as a lens for conceptual understanding across disciplines, and how this approach can be beneﬁcial for exploring topics that computer science educators might not normally consider to fall under the heading of ABM or MAS. We show that this perspective oﬀers insights for many sub-ﬁelds, including searching, sorting, optimization, graphics, machine learning, networks/security, and operating systems. In particular, we highlight several areas where parallel, distributed, stochastic, and emergent methods can be incorporated fruitfully into early computer science curricula that too often focus solely on serial, deterministic, and centralized algorithms. It is our belief that an ABM/MAS paradigm can also improve accessibility of content for students, by providing motivating example models, and a ‘glassbox’ approach that encourages both understanding and experimentation. Furthermore, bringing disparate topics in computer science together through the common focus on emergent systems can promote a broader, more accurate, view of the ﬁeld as a whole.},

This half-day workshop aims to bring together designers, researchers, and educators creating K-12 learning technologies to share and reflect on the challenges and opportunities of designing for sustainable use in classrooms. In the workshop, we seek to develop a set of heuristics to guide designers and provide a context for designing for sustainable use. By sharing the outcomes of this workshop we hope to develop a common language, design goals, and examples of successes and challenges in designing for sustainable use.},

Based on early prototyping conducted with several 7th grade classrooms, we sought to design a tool that would allow students to (a) integrate their data investigations with relevant personal and contextual information; (b) record the step-by-step process and rationale of their data analysis; and (c) reflect on and share these contextual and process-oriented elements of data analysis work with others. A major goal of Story Builder is to encourage students to consider and incorporate personal, social, and scientific considerations during data analysis.},

	abstract = {Educators are being encouraged to teach with “big” datasets that have more cases and attributes than are typically used in the classroom. When introduced carefully, these types of datasets can allow students to engage in complex and self-directed reasoning, develop data management and inquiry skills, and experience data analysis in a way that is more authentic to professional practice. However, “big data” is also often unwieldy. It can overwhelm students, overload their software tools, and interfere with planful analysis. How can we make such datasets manageable? This paper presents pedagogical strategies and technical methods for educators, educational designers, and young investigators to reduce the number of cases or attributes in a large dataset in ways that do not unduly compromise their analyses. We illustrate these strategies with interactive demonstrations in two freely-available open source tools: the Choosy plugin in CODAP, and a Python Jupyter notebook.},
